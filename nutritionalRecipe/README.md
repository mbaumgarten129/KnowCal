# KnowCal
For our project we made a Java console application.  The application allows users to enter in their recipes and receive
nutritional info for each one.  Additionally, the application forces the user to guess the number of calories in the 
recipe, with the goal of becoming more aware of daily calorie consumption.  Once the user
has been shown the nutritional information for the recipe, we search for lower calorie substitute ingredients for the highest
calorie ingredient in the recipe.  If one is found, the user is asked if they would like to make the substitution.  Finally, the recipe’s ingredients and nutrition facts are stored in a file on the user’s computer for future reference.
